# Overview

This is an attempt to expand my knowledge base by learning a programing language that I don't know as well as stretch myself and develope confindence in myself as a developer. 

This is a basic hello world program written in C++. 

I am learning a new programing language and need to start somewhere. This also acts as a test to see if I have the compiler and linker installed correctly.
